# Goals Overview

The goal of [Clcanny/shade-so](https://github.com/Clcanny/shade-so) is to imitate [Apache Maven Shade Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/), provide a tool that can shade elf-format dynamic link libraries (xxx\*\.so).

I hope shade-so can shadow all dependencies of famous softwares (such as [vim/vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) and [redis/redis](https://github.com/redis/redis)) and provide fat binaries.

# Progress

The project is currently in a very early stage, but it can shade dynamic linkg libraries with the following elements:

+ Global variables
+ External dependencies
+ etc.
